## Reporting a Vulnerability

### Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, we encourage you to report it as soon as possible. Your efforts to responsibly disclose vulnerabilities are crucial in helping us maintain the security of our project and its users. Hereâ€™s how to report a vulnerability and what to expect during the process:

#### 1. Where to Report
Please report vulnerabilities to our dedicated security team by emailing **[security@example.com](mailto:security@example.com)**. Ensure that your email includes the following details:
   - A clear and concise description of the vulnerability.
   - Steps to reproduce the issue (if applicable).
   - The impact or potential risk associated with the vulnerability.
   - Any possible suggestions for how the vulnerability could be mitigated.

#### 2. Response Time and Updates
We take all reports seriously and will do our best to respond within **48 hours** to acknowledge the receipt of your report. Our security team will investigate the issue, and you can expect regular updates throughout the process:
   - **Initial Acknowledgment**: Within 48 hours of your report.
   - **Investigation Update**: Within **5-7 business days** after acknowledgment, we will provide you with an update on the status of our investigation.
   - **Resolution/Next Steps**: Depending on the complexity of the vulnerability, a final decision and resolution may take **up to 30 days**.

#### 3. What to Expect if the Vulnerability is Accepted
   - We will work internally to patch the issue and may ask for further clarification or testing help.
   - Once resolved, we will provide public disclosure of the vulnerability along with credit (if desired), while ensuring that our users have ample time to update to the patched version before details are fully disclosed.
   - Depending on the severity and impact of the vulnerability, you may be eligible for a reward as part of our security bounty program.

#### 4. What Happens if the Vulnerability is Declined
   - If we determine that the issue is not a security vulnerability or does not pose a significant risk, we will provide a detailed explanation of our decision.
   - We may still consider your report for future improvements, and your efforts will be appreciated even if no immediate action is taken.

Thank you for helping us maintain the security and integrity of our project!
